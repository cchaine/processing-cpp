## Install

```
git clone https://github.com/cchaine/processing-cpp.git
cd processing-cpp
cmake .
make install
```

## Getting started

To start using the processing-cpp library, you need to create a `Sketch` class that inherits from the `PSketch` class

```cpp
#ifndef SKETCH_H
#define SKETCH_H

#include "psketch.h"

class Sketch : public PSketch {
public:
    Sketch();
    void setup();
    void draw();
    void keyEvent(int key, int action);
};

#endif
```

```cpp
#include "sketch.h"

int main() {
    Sketch * s = new Sketch();
    s->run();
    delete(s);
}
```
